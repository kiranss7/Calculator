## GitHub Upload Instructions

To upload this project to GitHub:

1.  **Initialize a Git repository in your project folder:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your `calculator-web-app` directory (the one containing `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`), and run:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2.  **Add your files to the staging area:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
    This command stages all changes in the current directory.

3.  **Commit your changes:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit: Basic Calculator Web App"
    ```
    Replace the message with a descriptive one for your first commit.

4.  **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
    * Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in to your account.
    * Click on the "+" sign in the top right corner and select "New repository."
    * Give your repository a name (e.g., `calculator-web-app`), add an optional description, and choose whether it's public or private. **Do not initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license** as you've already created your files locally.
    * Click "Create repository."

5.  **Link your local repository to the remote GitHub repository:**
    On the next page that GitHub shows after creating the repository, you'll see instructions under "…or push an existing repository from the command line." Copy and paste the two lines provided. They will look something like this (replace `YourUsername` and `calculator-web-app` with your actual details):
    ```bash
    git remote add origin [https://github.com/YourUsername/calculator-web-app.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/calculator-web-app.git)
    git branch -M main
    ```
    (Note: GitHub now defaults to `main` branch instead of `master`.)

6.  **Push your local commits to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

Your project will now be live on your GitHub repository!
